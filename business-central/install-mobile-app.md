## Using Business Central on-premises?

If you're using [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] on-premises, you can also enjoy the benefits of the mobile app. The installation is similar, but with a couple exceptions.

1. Install the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] app on your mobile device by downloading the app from the Windows Store, App Store, or Google Play.  

   - [Windows Store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=734848) (PC only)
   - [App Store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=734847)
   - [Google Play](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=734849)
2. Launch the app from your mobile device.
3. Instead of entering an email address on the **Welcome** page, select the option to **Connect to a local or hosted service**.
4. On the next page, in the **Service name** box, enter the web address that you use to open [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)], for example *https://mybusinesscentral:443/BC170*. If you're not sure, ask your administrator.
5. Next, enter your user name and password for accessing Business Central.

   When completed, the Business Central App will open.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're having problems getting the app to work properly, talk with your administrator. It could be a missing prerequisite or an incomplete configuration.
