# Searching for Customers, Vendors, and Other Contacts from Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [online_only](includes/online_only.md)]. Introduced in 2021 release wave 1.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has a comprehensive business contact management system that is essential for users in sales, operations, or other departmental roles. If you're a user in one of these roles, you'll often need to look up, meet, or start a conversation with your vendors, customers, and other contacts. With the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app for Teams, you can do these tasks directly from Teams, without having to switch to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. From within Teams, you can:

- Look up [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] contacts from the Teams command box or from the message compose area. Contacts can include prospects, vendors, customers, or other business relationships.
- Share a contact as card in a Teams conversation.
- View details about contact information, interaction history, and other insights like outstanding payments or open documents.

## Prerequisites

- You have access to Microsoft Teams.
- You've installed the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app in Teams. For more information, see [Install the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] App for Microsoft Teams](across-install-app-for-teams.md)

## Look up contacts from the command box

The command box is at the top of every screen in Teams. It lets you search, take quick actions, or launch apps, like the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] app.

1. In the command box, type **@Business Central**, then select the Business Central app from the results.

2. In the **Business Central** box, start typing search text, like a name, address, or phone number.

    As you type, results will appear.

3. Select a contact from the results.

    The contact card appears beneath the command box.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to add the contact card into a conversation, go to the upper right corner of the card, select **... (More options)** > **Copy**. Then, paste the copy in the message compose box of a conversation.  

For more information about the command box in Teams, see [Teams - Use the command box](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-the-command-box-13c4e429-7324-4886-b377-5dbed539193b).

## Look up contacts from the message compose box

The advantage of using the message compose box is that you can add a contact card directly to a conversation.

1. Beneath to message compose box, select the **Business Central** icon to launch the app.

    If you don't see the **Business Central** icon, select **... (Messaging extensions)**.

    As you type, results will appear.

3. Select a contact from the results.

    The contact card appears in the message compose box.

## Viewing contact card details

The contact card in Teams gives you a quick overview of the customer, vendor, or contact. The card is interactive&mdash;meaning you can view more information or even modify a contact by using the **Details** or **Pop-out** buttons.

The **Details** button opens a window within Teams that displays more information about the contact, but not as much as you'd see in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. To see all the information about a contact in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

The contact card works just like cards for records, like items, customers, or sales orders. For more information about cards, see [View card details](across-working-with-teams.md#view-card-details).

> [!NOTE]
> All participants in a Teams conversation will be able to view cards for Business Central contact that you submit to a conversation. But to view more details about records, by using the **Details** or **Pop out** buttons on a card, they'll need access to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. For more information, see [Managing Microsoft Teams Integration](admin-teams-integration.md#minimum-requirements-1).
