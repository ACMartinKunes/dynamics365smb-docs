# Define Retention Policies
Retention policies define how frequently you want Business Central to delete outdated data, such as log entries and archived records that you don't want to keep long-term. You can set filters on your data to specify how long you want to keep it, and Business Central will automatically delete the data when that period expires.

When you define a retention policy, you specify the tables to include in the policy on the **Allowed Tables** page.

You muist have the Dynamics 365 Full Business Access permission set.
