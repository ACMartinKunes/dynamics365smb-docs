# The Accountant Portal for Business Central Extension

This application has been deprecated. We recommend that you do not install this extension but sign up for [!INCLUDE [prodshort](includes/prodshort.md)] at [Business Central on Microsoft.com](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/) instead. You can then use the company hub to manage work across multiple companies.

For more information, see [Manage Work across Multiple Companies in the Company Hub](company-hub.md).
