# The VAT Group Extension
You can team up with one or more other businesses in your country to consolidate VAT reporting under a single registration number. This type of arrangement is known as a _VAT group_. You can engage with the group as a member or the group representative.

> [!NOTE]
> VAT reports contain customer data. That data will be deleted after 30 days.

## Setting Up VAT Groups
Regardless of whether you are joining a VAT group as a member or a representative, the VAT Report Setup assisted setup guide can help you get going. The guide will help you define the periods of time the VAT submission covers, and specify the group members and the representative.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you start the assisted setup guide, contact all members of the group to get their VAT registration numbers. You must provide VAT registration numbers when you add members to the group.

### To use the VAT Report Setup assisted setup guide
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Report Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Complete the steps in the assisted setup guide. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)] 

## Tasks for VAT Group Members
As a member of a VAT group, you must submit your VAT return to the group representative.

### To submit VAT amounts to your group representative
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Returns**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]

### Leaving a VAT Group
If you no longer want to participate in a VAT group, you can exit the group and use the standard VAT reporting process instead. For more information, see [Set Up Value-Added Tax](finance-setup-vat.md).

## To verify that the representative submitted your VAT report
You can verify that your group representative has submitted the VAT report to the tax authority. On the **Group VAT Returns** page, the **VAT Returns** column displays the status of the report.

## Tasks for the VAT Group Representative
As the group representative, you must receive, consolidate, and submit VAT amounts to your tax authority.

### Receive VAT Amounts from Group Members
1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Group VAT Submissions**, and then choose the related link.

### Inspect VAT submissions from group members
You can view the details about a VAT report that a member submitted. On the **VAT Return Periods** page, choose the submission that you are interested in, and then choose the **Group Member Submissions** field.

### Submit VAT to your tax authority
All members of the VAT group must submit their VAT returns to you before you can submit the consolidated information to your tax authority.

> [!TIP]
> After you submit the VAT return, members cannot update the VAT report they submitted to you. If you need to update the report, choose **Reopen**.
