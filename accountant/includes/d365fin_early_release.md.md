> [!INCLUDE [d365acc_long_md](d365acc_long_md.md)] has been in public preview in a limited number of markets. Based on feedback from the preview, [!INCLUDE [d365acc_md](d365acc_md.md)] has been replaced by new functionality in [!INCLUDE [d365fin_long_md](d365fin_long_md.md)] in 2020 release wave 2. From July 1st, 2020, new users have not been able to sign up to [!INCLUDE [d365acc_md](d365acc_md.md)]. Existing users will continue to have full access until [!INCLUDE [d365acc_md](d365acc_md.md)] is deprecated in 2020 release wave 2. But the clock is ticking, so take a look at the company hub in [!INCLUDE [d365fin_long_md](d365fin_long_md.md)] already today. For more information, see [Manage Work across Multiple Companies in the Company Hub](/dynamics365/business-central/company-hub).  

If you currently use [!INCLUDE [d365acc_md](d365acc_md.md)], we recommend that you start thinking about next steps now. We have made it easy to take your data with you, both if you choose to switch to [!INCLUDE [d365fin_md](d365fin_md.md)], or if you choose to switch to another product.  

If you want to switch to the company hub in [!INCLUDE [d365fin_md](d365fin_md.md)], simply use the **Edit in Excel** action on the **Clients** list page to export data from [!INCLUDE [d365acc_md](d365acc_md.md)], and then open a similar Excel spreadsheet from your new company hub. Then, use copy and paste to move the data and finally publish the new spreadsheet to get the data into the company hub in [!INCLUDE [d365fin_md](d365fin_md.md)]. For more information, see [Exporting Your Business Data to Excel](/dynamics365/business-central/about-export-data) in the Help for [!INCLUDE [d365fin_md](d365fin_md.md)].
